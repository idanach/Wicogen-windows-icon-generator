Easily Customize your folders and make Windows suite to your taste!
You can create folders from existing icons, apply them to folders, or even search the net for icons you like!

Supported sources for online search: 
Google images 
Bing images
IMDB (covers for movies and TV folders)
For Movie/TV, I recommend the disk style available in the drop-down.

NOTICE:
After generating the icons for existing folders, it can take a couple of minutes to refresh (When creating new folders from icons, It should be instantaneous).

If you find all the settings confusing, hover over the button. 
A Tooltip window will pop up.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to do so in the discussions!
