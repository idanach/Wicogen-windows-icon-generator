# Wicogen
Easily Customize your folders and make Windows suite to your taste!<br />
You can create folders from existing icons, apply them to folders, or even search the net for icons you like!

Download the portable program: [Wicogen](https://github.com/idanach/Wicogen-windows-icon-generator/releases/tag/V1.0.0)

Supported sources for online search: 
  - Google images 
  - Bing images
  - IMDB (covers for movies and TV folders)
For Movie/TV, I recommend the disk style available in the drop-down.

If you find all the settings confusing, hover over the button, a Tooltip window will pop up.

For any questions or suggestions, feel free to do so in the discussions! üí¨

# NOTICE:
After generating the icons for existing folders, it can take a couple of minutes to refresh (When creating new folders from icons, It should be instantaneous).
