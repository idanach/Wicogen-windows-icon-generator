# Wicogen
Easily Customize your folders and make Windows suite to your taste!<br />
Just choose an image and it will be automatically applied to a folder of your choice!
Quickly search the net for images you like by a folder name and a search term!

Now only in the setup vertion:
  - A context menu for windows explorer!
      - Set image as folder icon
      - Choose image for folder
      - Reset folder icon to default
      - Clear windows icon cache

Download the portable program: [Wicogen](https://github.com/idanach/Wicogen-windows-icon-generator/releases)

Supported sources for online search: 
  - Google images 
  - Bing images
  - IMDB (covers for movies and TV shows)
  - MyAnimeList.net (covers for anime and movies)

For Movie/TV, I recommend the disk style available in the "Style:" drop-down.

If you find all the settings confusing, hover over them for a second, a Tooltip window will pop up.

For any questions or suggestions, feel free to do so in the discussions! üí¨

# NOTICE:
After generating the icons for existing folders, it can take a couple of minutes to refresh (When creating new folders from icons, It should be instantaneous).
